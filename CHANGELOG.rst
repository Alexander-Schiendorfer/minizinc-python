Unreleased_
------------

Added
^^^^^
- Support and testing for Python 3.8
- Logging of started processes and attributes of generated output items

Changed
^^^^^^^
- ``Driver.check_version`` now raises an ``ConfigurationError`` exception
  when an incompatible function is detected; otherwise, the method not return a
  value.
- Output classes generated by ``CLIIinstance.analyse()`` no longer contain
  the `_output_item` `str` attribute when MiniZinc does not find a output item.
  (New in MiniZinc 2.3.3)

Fixed
^^^^^
- ``CLIInstance.solutions()``: The separator detection is now OS independent.
  The separator previously included a ``\n`` literal instead of ``\r\n`` on
  Windows.
- Solve an issue in ``CLIInstance.solution()`` where a solution with a size
  bigger than the buffer size would result in a ``LimitOverrunError`` exception.
- Correctly catch the ``asyncio.TimeoutError`` and kill the process when
  reaching a hard timeout. (i.e., the solver and ``minizinc`` do not stop in
  time)
- Check if file exists before opening file when an error occurs. (File might
  have been part of a compiled solver)
